Accounts payable transactions, and reading existing CLIEOP files is planned to be
supported

== CLIEOP format

CLIEOP03 is a file format that is used for communication about cash transaction
between bank accounts. It is used in the Netherlands and is supported by the
banking software packages of the main banks. CLIEOP supports transactions in both
directions: accounts payable and accounts receivable. For accounts receivable,
you need proper authorization from your bank.

For more information about the CLIEOP file format, see:
